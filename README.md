# TriviaNation

A  networked   trivia   game   designed   for   use   in   classrooms.   Class
members are each in control of a nation on a map. The goal of the game is to increase
the size of the nation by winning trivia challenges and defeating other class members
in   contested   territories.   The   focus   is   on   gamifying   learning   and   making   it   an
enjoyable experience.

This specific branch is for the purpose of setting up the question editor for the administrator to add, edit, delete questions in the database for the game.
